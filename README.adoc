= Getting Things Done

Inspired by http://hamberg.no/gtd/

This will be an implementation of the GTD lists.

The first release will have:

* a responsive layout
* drag'n'drop moving of items between lists
* autocompletion for contexts
* a LocalStorage backend so that it is offline capable


Brainstorm
- 3 regular columns (collapse to swipable single column on small screens)
- drag and drop between columns
- similar to the way trello does it
